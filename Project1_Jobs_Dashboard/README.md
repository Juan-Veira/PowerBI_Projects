## Introduction

This dashboard is designed to help users explore the data job market in a simple and intuitive way. By slicing, filtering, and drilling down into the data, you can quickly spot patterns and answer real questions about salaries, roles, and trends in the data field.

You’ll find salary insights by job title, year, and hourly rate, with the ability to dig deeper depending on the role you’re interested in. The goal is to give you a clear picture of the market so you can make more confident, better-informed career decisions.

This project was created following a course by **Luke Barousse** — big thanks to him for the clear explanations and great learning material that made this dashboard possible.
